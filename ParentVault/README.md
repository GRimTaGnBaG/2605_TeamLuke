# ParentVault

ParentVault is a security-first mobile app for parents to manage child profiles, custody/school/event/medication schedules, AI-assisted imports, medication confirmations, custom notifications, and event journaling.

## Apps

- `apps/mobile` — Expo React Native app for Android and iOS.
- `apps/api` — Node/Fastify backend skeleton designed for cloud-first deployment and later self-hosting.
- `packages/shared` — shared TypeScript domain models.

## MVP included

- Schedule-only mode: parents can use reminders without entering optional child profile, medical, insurance, school, custody, journal, media, AI, or web-enrichment data.
- Detailed child vault: legal/preferred name, birthdate, SSN last-four/encrypted SSN, allergies, conditions, medications, emergency contacts, doctors, dentists, pharmacies, insurance provider, pharmacy/refill details, school, and custody/legal notes.
- Bot completeness assistant: notices missing details parents may not think to add, but every prompt is skippable and respects privacy/feature settings.
- Security/2FA scaffold: required second factor design, local vault unlock settings, demo 2FA API challenge flow, and step-up verification policy.
- Encryption policy and code boundary: sensitive child data must never be persisted in plaintext; encrypted-value models and secure-storage guardrails are included.
- School enrichment workflow: search/draft school address, phone, hours, website, calendar URL, and out-of-school dates, then require parent confirmation before saving.
- Schedule items: custody, school, event, medication, appointment.
- Natural-language chat commands for schedule/profile adjustments plus RAG-style factual Q&A from the vault.
- AI import placeholders for calendars, decrees, flyers, screenshots, and images.
- Nanny-style notifications without Discord: day-before, day-of, hour-before, pickup timing, therapy planning/hour-before, medication due, nightly journal prompt, and monthly calendar prep.
- Medication reminders with mark-as-taken.
- Evidence-grade journal scaffold: event date/time, entered-at metadata, type/category, notes, people/location, photos, screenshots, camera capture, attachment metadata, and export manifest preview.
- Medical logging through the journal for symptoms, medication events, appointments, doctor calls, and photos.
- Local notification preference model: day before, day of, hour before, custom minutes.
- Backend adapter boundary so cloud and self-host modes can share the same app surface.

## Start mobile app

If you are new to the project, start here first:

- `docs/BEGINNER_START_HERE.md` — plain-English guide to run, read, and safely edit the project.
- `docs/DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md` — safe edit/check/commit workflow.
- `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` — common problems and how to fix them.
- `docs/CODE_ORGANIZATION.md` — where each tab/page and helper file lives.

Quick run command:

```bash
npm install
npm run mobile
```

Then press `a` for Android emulator/device or `i` for iOS simulator on macOS.

## Security posture

ParentVault handles extremely sensitive child data including SSNs and medical details. The production path should include:

- End-to-end encryption or per-user envelope encryption before cloud persistence.
- Device biometrics/PIN gate.
- Strict audit logs.
- Zero plaintext SSN logging.
- Image/OCR processing with explicit consent and deletion controls.
- Data export/delete flows.
- Self-host pairing using local-network discovery or relay with user-owned keys.
