/**
 * PARENTVAULT-COMMENTARY
 *
 * Placeholder boundary for secure device storage and encrypted local cache behavior.
 *
 * The file documents where sensitive persistence should eventually route instead of plain AsyncStorage/in-memory demo state.
 *
 * Do not store real child data here until encryption, unlock, wipe-on-logout, and redaction requirements are implemented.
 *
 * Reading guide:
 * - Comments in this project explain product intent, privacy/security boundaries, and why a flow exists.
 * - They are deliberately more detailed than normal production comments because this prototype is being shared for learning, review, and handoff.
 * - If code and comments ever disagree, fix both together; stale privacy/security comments are dangerous.
