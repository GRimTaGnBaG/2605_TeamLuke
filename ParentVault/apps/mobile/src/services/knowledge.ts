/**
 * PARENTVAULT-COMMENTARY
 *
 * Builds searchable knowledge sources from profiles, schedules, and journal entries for factual Q&A.
 *
 * This keeps chat answers grounded in stored vault data instead of free-form guessing.
 *
 * Only include data the parent has consented to store/use, and cite sources where possible.
 *
 * Reading guide:
 * - Comments in this project explain product intent, privacy/security boundaries, and why a flow exists.
 * - They are deliberately more detailed than normal production comments because this prototype is being shared for learning, review, and handoff.
 * - If code and comments ever disagree, fix both together; stale privacy/security comments are dangerous.
