/**
 * PARENTVAULT-COMMENTARY
 *
 * Computes missing child-vault details and suggests what parents may want to add next.
 *
 * The goal is helpful completeness, not pressure: optional sensitive categories must stay skippable.
 *
 * Keep recommendations practical, privacy-aware, and focused on parent usefulness.
 *
 * Reading guide:
 * - Comments in this project explain product intent, privacy/security boundaries, and why a flow exists.
 * - They are deliberately more detailed than normal production comments because this prototype is being shared for learning, review, and handoff.
 * - If code and comments ever disagree, fix both together; stale privacy/security comments are dangerous.
